 italy.1.t:0 "Death of the Duce"
 italy.1.d:0 "Benito Mussolini took power as Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and solidified his rule as dictator in January of 1925. Now, after more than three decades as Italy's all-powerful Duce, he passed away at the age of 77 after a short struggle with liver cancer.\n\nHis death leaves a significant power vacuum, as he had previously spent much effort to eliminate all internal political opposition. Mussolini disbanded the Grand Council of Fascism in 1952, purged most army generals in 1955 and eventually cracked down even on his most loyal fascistic comrades in 1957, when he saw to the execution or exile of most major fascists, with the only two notable exceptions being his longest political associate, Italo Balbo, and his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano.\n\nMussolini prepared a political testament designating Balbo as his successor as Duce in 1959, in anticipation of his imminent death. This offended Ciano, who had expected to succeed his father-in-law himself. Balbo is highly unpopular as he, initially a big adversary of Germany, totally flipped his political profile after the victory in the war, so much so that he gained the nickname "Little Adolf" among his fascist contemporaries - before the Duce purged them all, anyway."
 italy.1.o1:0 "A great loss to the nation!"
 italy.2.t:0 "The Choice of Succession"
 italy.2.d:0 "In the wake of the Duce's passing, the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, the 'Grand Council of Fascism', has been called back into action for the first time since its dissolution eight years ago, filled with inexperienced political newcomers, as most of the previous members found a violent end at the end of a bayonet in 1957, when the Duce purged most major fascists.\n\nThe only notable name sitting on the Grand Council is Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, who has led a violent and fiery campaign against Mussolini's testamental designation of Italo Balbo, calling the testament a German forgery and Balbo a German puppet.\n\nCiano has now suggested a brave plan as a counterpoint: To announce the former political prisoner and socialist Pietro Nenni, who underwent a political rehabilitation as a fascist, although he never quite dropped his concern on behalf of the working poor and advocated a move away from a corporatist model to support a stronger welfare state. Ciano suggested a restriction of the powers connected to the office of Prime Minister and to abolish the title of "Duce" completely.\n\nThis has most of the council members worried however, who see a return to socialist poplicy as a way to isolate Italy internationally and give the Germans a pretext of invasion. They instead favor one of their own, an economic corporatist by the name of Amintore Fanfani. Fanfani, just like Ciano, advocates to reduce the totalitarian power of the Duce and a return to the office of Prime Minister. He instead seeks to tie the King back into the political sphere."
 italy.2.o1:0 "Balbo was the designated Duce!"
 italy.2.o2:0 "Fanfani is good for the economy, fools!"
 italy.2.o3:0 "The plan with Nenni might just be crazy enough to work."
