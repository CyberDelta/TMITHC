 italy.1.t:0 "Death of the Duce"
 italy.1.d:0 "Benito Mussolini took power as Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 and solidified his rule as dictator in January of 1925. Now, after more than three decades as Italy's all-powerful Duce, he passed away at the age of 77 after a short struggle with liver cancer.\n\nHis death leaves a significant power vacuum, as he had previously spent much effort to eliminate all internal political opposition. Mussolini disbanded the Grand Council of Fascism in 1952, purged most army generals in 1955 and eventually cracked down even on his most loyal fascistic comrades in 1957, when he saw to the execution or exile of most major fascists, with the only two notable exceptions being his longest political associate, Italo De Vecchi, and his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano.\n\nMussolini prepared a political testament designating De Vecchi as his successor as Duce in 1959, in anticipation of his imminent death. This offended Ciano, who had expected to succeed his father-in-law himself. De Vecchi is highly unpopular as he, initially a big adversary of Germany, totally flipped his political profile after the victory in the war, so much so that he gained the nickname "Little Adolf" among his fascist contemporaries - before the Duce purged them all, anyway."
 italy.1.o1:0 "A great loss to the nation!"
 italy.2.t:0 "The Choice of Succession"
 italy.2.d:0 "In the wake of the Duce's passing, the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, the 'Grand Council of Fascism', has been called back into action for the first time since its dissolution eight years ago, filled with inexperienced political newcomers, as most of the previous members found a violent end at the end of a bayonet in 1957, when the Duce purged most major fascists.\n\nThe only notable name sitting on the Grand Council is Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, who has led a violent and fiery campaign against Mussolini's testamental designation of Cesare Maria De Vecchi, calling the testament a German forgery and De Vecchi a German puppet.\n\nCiano has now suggested a brave plan as a counterpoint: To announce the former political prisoner and socialist Pietro Nenni, who underwent a political rehabilitation as a fascist, although he never quite dropped his concern on behalf of the working poor and advocated a move away from a corporatist model to support a stronger welfare state. Ciano suggested a restriction of the powers connected to the office of Prime Minister and to abolish the title of "Duce" completely.\n\nThis has most of the council members worried however, who see a return to socialist poplicy as a way to isolate Italy internationally and give the Germans a pretext of invasion. They instead favor one of their own, an economic corporatist by the name of Amintore Fanfani. Fanfani, just like Ciano, advocates to reduce the totalitarian power of the Duce and a return to the office of Prime Minister. He instead seeks to tie the King back into the political sphere."
 italy.2.o1:0 "De Vecchi was the designated Duce!"
 italy.2.o2:0 "Fanfani is good for the economy, fools!"
 italy.2.o3:0 "The plan with Nenni might just be crazy enough to work."
 italy.3.t:0 "Reinstatement of the Quadrumvirs"
 italy.3.d:0 "When the Grand Council of Fascism was installed, Mussolini selected four of his loyal followers to become the Quadrumvirs, an office inspired by Ancient Rome. The original four were Italo Balbo, Michele Bianchi, Emilio De Bono and Cesare Maria De Vecchi. When the world war concluded, only De Bono and De Vecchi were left. De Bono lived to the impressive age of 91 and passed away in 1957, leaving only De Vecchi, Mussolini's testamental heir apparent. By then, the Duce had already dissolved the Grand Council, including the Quadrumvirs.\n\nNow that the preparations for Case E require new Quadrumvirs, several provincial fascists who were unaffected by Mussolini's previous purges have risen to the task. Among them are:\n\n-the well-connected corporate sweetheart, Amintore Fanfani\n-Italy's highest scoring fighter ace of the world war, Adriano Visconti\n-the only field marshal to survive Mussolini's military purges, Giovanni Messe\n-Victor Emmanuel IV, son of King Umberto II and Crown Prince of Italy\n\nFearful of Mussolini's notorious ill temper, these four men now request assurances of position and responsibility as well as political immunity."
 italy.3.o1:0 "It has to be done."
 italy.3.o2:0 "Withhold any such assurances."
 italy.4.t:0 "The Question of Italian Succession"
 italy.4.d:0 "With the death of the Duce, it has become clear that it is far from a foregone conclusion that Mussolini's appointed heir, Cesare Maria De Vecchi, will actually be able to secure power. In fact, it seems quite possible that Amintore Fanfani, a mainline Italian fascist and open Germanophobe who according to our secret service wants to raise military spending and fortify the border against us, might secure the post of Prime Minister from within the Quadrumvirs.\n\nWe now have the possibility to openly endorse De Vecchi to become Duce - the Italians will not appreciate any involvement in their internal policy, but it would serve as justification before our own people to move against their choice if they decide to defy our request."
 italy.4.o1:0 "Endorse De Vecchi."
 italy.4.o2:0 "Italy's choice does not concern us."
 italy.5.t:0 "Germany endorses De Vecchi"
 italy.5.d:0 "In a baffling endorsement, the German Führer's office has made a public statement endorsing the will of the late Italian Duce and stressing the need for Italy to follow it verbatim for the sake of world peace.\n\nThis undermines Italian sovereignity to an epic extent, as it quite obviously serves as a pretext for action against Italy should we choose to go against Germany's expressed wishes."
 italy.5.o1:0 "They shouldn't get involved in our affairs."
 italy.6.t:0 "The Question of Italian Succession"
 italy.6.d:0 "With the death of the Italian Duce, it appears as if Spain's oldest and most faithful partner and ally is now in a precarious spot. Mussolini prepared a political testament which elevates one Cesare Maria De Vecchi to be the Duce's successor.\n\nThat can't happen! De Vecchi is a noted enemy of Spain and has in the past advocated at least twice, first in 1949 and then again in 1952, for an aggressive war by Italy upon Spain to capture the Balearic Islands. De Vecchi will also firmly put Italy into Germany's political camp and thus might even threaten a dissolution of mainland Spain at German hands should the Führer will it so.\n\nThe alternative to De Vecchi is Amintore Fanfani, a corporatist and hispanophile who has made some successful business trips to Spain and is enamoured with our country, people and culture. War between our two nations is not an issue with him. We could contact the Italian government and strongly suggest that Mussolini's testament was a forgery in order to grant the decision to the Quadrumvirs of the Grand Council of Fascism in Rome. They would surely select one of their own, Fanfani."
 italy.6.o1:0 "The testament was a forgery!"
 italy.6.o2:0 "It's not worth it."
 italy.7.t:0 "Spain doubts Mussolini's political testament"
 italy.7.d:0 "In a short but bitter note to the Italian government, the Spanish government in Madrid pointed out several perceived flaws with the late Duce's political testament, including the date and signature. The Spanish ambassador presented what he claims to be an intercepted telegram between the German consulate in Milan and the domicile of Cesare Maria De Vecchi, Mussolini's favored heir and successor. The telegram shows a large sum of money offered to De Vecchi should he declare willing to cede South Tyrol to Germany and undergo several governmental and military reforms, like allowing Wehrmacht troops to garrison Italian cities - effectively turning Italy into a German puppet.\n\nWhen questioned about the telegram, De Vecchi pointed out that there is no telegraph at his home and he thus couldn't have received a telegram."
 italy.7.o1:0 "Still, suspicion remains."

 italy_news.1.t:0 "Mussolini dies"
 italy_news.1.d:0 "At the advanced age of 77, Benito Mussolini, Prime Minister and fascist 'Duce' of the Italy and its empire, had passed away. He was the first fascist dictator in the world and in many ways the father of the ideology that now rules the planet. His many titles, awarded by the late King Victor Emmanuel III and his son Umberto II, included 'Liberator of the Balkans', 'Champion of the Italian People', 'Restitutor' and 'Conqueror of Suez'.\nHis passing leaves many question marks, as Mussolini spent the past decade purging Italy's high-level fascists, murdering most men that would have been capable of replacing him. His declared will is to have power pass to Cesare Maria De Vecchi - but the problem is that no one else in Italy likes him."
 italy_news.1.ITA.o:0 "A tragedy!"
 italy_news.1.ITA_puppet.o:0 "This brings us closer to freedom."
 italy_news.1.GER.o:0 "He has been with us since the Anschluss. He will be missed."
 italy_news.1.generic.fascism.o:0 "The father of fascism is dead."
 italy_news.1.generic.nonfascism.o:0 "Even dictators die."
 italy_news.2.t:0 "De Vecchi becomes Duce"
 italy_news.2.d:0 "About a month after the Duce's passing, the Grand Council of Fascism in Rome has concluded their meetings and deliberated to fill the vacant spot of Italy's dictatorship in accordance with Mussolini's last will. Cesare Maria De Vecchi will become Duce of Italy at the age of 76, much to the enjoyment of the German ambassador in Rome, Richard von Weizsäcker, who transmitted Berlin's congratulations. On the other hand, Spain has already announced their deep concern with the choice - De Vecchi previously advocated for a territorial war between Italy and Spain over the Balearic Islands. His appointment is a signal to Madrid that the two countries might find themselves at odds in the western Mediterranean soon."
 italy_news.2.ITA.o:0 "As Mussolini envisioned."
 italy_news.2.ITA_puppet.o1:0 "Send a letter of congratulations."
 italy_news.2.ITA_puppet.o2:0 "Yet another puppet master."
 italy_news.2.GER.o:0 "An excellent choice!"
 italy_news.2.SPR.o:0 "War with Italy might be inevitable."
 italy_news.2.generic.fascism.o:0 "How will Spain react?"
 italy_news.2.generic.nonfascism.o:0 "Fascists. I hate these guys."
 italy_news.3.t:0 "Fanfani becomes Prime Minister of Italy"
 italy_news.3.d:0 "The late Duce, Benito Mussolini, had willed one Cesare Maria de Vecchi to become his successor as Italy's dictator, but about a month after Mussolini's death, the conclusion of the Grand Council of Fascism's deliberations have resulted in the appointment of one Amintore Fanfani as Head of Government, bundled with a set of legislation limiting the power of the executive and reinstating limited authorities to the legislative and judicial branches of government. Fanfani will also not carry the title of "Duce", opting instead for the less offensive "Prime Minister of Italy". Fanfani was the favorite of the Catholic conservative middle and upper classes in Italy and has political connections to Spain and Portugal. His choice will however raise eyebrows in Berlin, as Fanfani was well-known for his advocacy of political distance to Germany."
 italy_news.3.ITA.o:0 "Good!"
 italy_news.3.ITA_puppet.o1:0 "Send a letter of congratulations."
 italy_news.3.ITA_puppet.o2:0 "Yet another puppet master."
 italy_news.3.GER.o:0 "What an idiotic choice."
 italy_news.3.SPR.o:0 "Catholic conservatives unite!"
 italy_news.3.generic.fascism.o:0 "A moderate, yet safe choice."
 italy_news.3.generic.nonfascism.o:0 "He's just a different brand of fascist."
 italy_news.4.t:0 "Nenni becomes Prime Minister of Italy"
 italy_news.4.d:0 "In a most stunning turn of events, the Grand Council of Fascism did not only go against the stated will of the late Duce Benito Mussolini in regards to his succesor, but it also elevated a completely unknown yet highly controversial politician into Italy's highest office. Pietro Nenni is a former member of the Socialist Party, anti-fascist and critic of Mussolini's government before undergoing a political rehabilitation in the early 1950s. He became a hero of the Italian working class as a provincial administrator in southern Italy and was considered the foremost anti-corporatist in the Italian government. Under his watch, Italy may yet revert from Mussolini's corporatism back to a social welfare state. Nenni is also considered an adversary of both Spain and Germany and advocates the creation of an independent Italian power bloc in the Mediterranean."
 italy_news.4.ITA.o:0 "A new era for Italy."
 italy_news.4.ITA_puppet.o1:0 "Send a letter of congratulations."
 italy_news.4.ITA_puppet.o2:0 "Yet another puppet master."
 italy_news.4.GER.o:0 "A former communist?!"
 italy_news.4.SPR.o:0 "Not the choice we wanted, but also not a pro-German choice at least. Still a commie."
 italy_news.4.generic.fascism.o:0 "This might well be a betrayal to fascism!"
 italy_news.4.generic.nonfascism.o:0 "Could that mean the end of Italian fascism?"
 italy_news.5.t:0 "Italy throws off the Nazi yoke"
 italy_news.5.d:0 "It has been long asserted that the Italian Empire is little more than a glorified extension of the German sphere of influence - but it has more and more been clarified by the new Italian leadership that they won't tolerate any German overreach. Now, more than a dozen cancelled joint research projects, more than 20 closed German consulates and more than 50 incidents in German-speaking South Tyrol later it is more than clear that Italy does not have any elevated respect left for their former senior partner of the Axis Powers."
 italy_news.5.ITA.o:0 "Italians shall never, never, never be enslaved!"
 italy_news.5.GER.o:0 "What do you mean, 'yoke'?!"
 italy_news.5.ITA_puppet.o:0 "Italy recognizes that being a puppet is bad? Well, would you look at that."
 italy_news.5.GER_puppet.o:0 "How sad, it's almost getting lonely in the club of German puppet states."
 italy_news.5.generic.o:0 "Good for them?"
 italy_news.6.t:0 "Italy becomes German puppet"
 italy_news.6.d:0 "As Wehrmacht troops move into Italy to take prearranged garrison positions, it is clear that the Italian leadership was unable to shake off the international assertions that their state was little more than a glorified German puppet. Now, to speak even of glorification would be fallacious: Italy can no longer make decisions independently of its major ally. It is nothing more than a puppet."
 italy_news.6.ITA.o:0 "Oh no!"
 italy_news.6.GER.o:0 "Yeah, what else is new?"
 italy_news.6.ITA_puppet.o:0 "Does that mean freedom for us?!"
 italy_news.6.GER_puppet.o:0 "Yay, another partner!"
 italy_news.6.generic.o:0 "Germany grows ever stronger."
