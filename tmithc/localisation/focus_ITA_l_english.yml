 ITA_prepare_for_case_e_desc:0 "Case E (short for emergenza, 'emergency') is the series of government operations first outlined by the Duce in 1949 in case of his death or incapacitation. Case E describes a sweeping reform of the PNF, the governing fascists, to allow young policymakers and administrators to replace the old guard. Mussolini, ever distrustful of rivals, prefers to see his old comrade Cesare Maria de Vecchi to succeed him as Duce."

 ITA_rivitalizzazione_desc:0 "Nenni, even after joining the PNF, never fully abandoned leftism. In Calabria, he kept employment and even work safety of dock workers in Taranto and other cities in mind, causing dismay among capitalists but pleasing the workers. As leader, he has a plan of "Rivitalizzazione", 'revitalization', to get the economy running. The corporatists warn that his welfare and spending plans scream of communism."

 ITA_legacy_of_the_psi_desc:0 "As part of the social liberalizations that Nenni aspires to, the PNF's grip on educational primacy must be revised and replaced with a system more in line with the Italian enlightenment thinkers of old. The people need to be reminded that, just like Nenni, the late Duce was once part of the PSI, the Italian Socialist Party. These old values aren't as hostile to Italy as they were led to believe in the past 30 years."
 ITA_the_western_motorways:0 "The Western Motorways"
 ITA_the_western_motorways_desc:0 "A long promised infrastructural improvement, the Western Motorways were the late Duce's idea during the late 40s and early 50s, inspired by the German Autobahn system to advance Italian overland connection. The initial plans got bogged down by funding shortages and the increased priority given to the eastern routes in the former Yugoslavia. Nenni holds it vital to get Savoy connected to the rest of Italy."
 ITA_legalize_labor_unions:0 "Legalize Labor Unions"
 ITA_legalize_labor_unions_desc:0 "One of the central plans outlined by Pietro Nenni to increase economic output was to raise wages for the working class through the relegalization of labor unions. This allows the proletarians to go on strike independently and fight for higher wages from their employers without the need of government assistance. The state will keep itself backdoors however, to prevent for example labor strikes during war."
