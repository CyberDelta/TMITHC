 decisions_german_influence_in_italy_desc:0 "While often seen as a German puppet, Italy has remained at least partially more resilient to Germany's political and diplomatic overreach than other countries have been able to. However, the possibility of Italy falling into the German sphere remains a real possibility.\n\nCurrent German Influence in Italy: ([?ITA.var_german_influence_in_italy|0H]).\n\nIf this influence reaches 100, Germany can make Italy a subject.\nIf it reaches 0, Italy can end the mechanic permanently and get rid of all associated debuffs. Italy will retain the debuffs even if a German puppet. All Italian puppets will break free from both Italy and Germany if Italy becomes a German puppet.\n\nWar between Italy and Germany will cancel the mechanic early and Italy will lose the debuffs."

Italy is ready!"
